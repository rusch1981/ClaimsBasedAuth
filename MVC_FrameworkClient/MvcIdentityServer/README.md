# MVCIdentityServer
This Client was created based off of MVC Owin Client (Implicit) that can be found 
[IdentityServer3.Samples.](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3.Samples).

The current configuration is set to work with IdenityServer4Example server using Windows 
Authentication. No Configuration for Windows Authentication is required via
the client.  The README in IdenityServer4Example notes the important configuration 
aspects at a server level.
