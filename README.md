**App_Start/Startup.Auth.cs** — Contains the authentication configuration setup during bootstrap of 
ASP.NET MVC application.

**App_Start/IdentityConfig.cs** — Configuring and extending ASP.NET Identity:

**ApplicationUserManager** - This class extends UserManager from ASP.NET Identity. 
Password construction rules, account lockout settings, and two-factor messages are configured here.

**Models/IdentityModels.cs** — This class defines the User Identity that is used in authentication and stored
to the database (ApplicationUser extends IdentityUser from ASP.NET Identity). The "default" database 
schema provided by ASP.NET Identity is limited of the box. It is generated by the EntityFramework with
CodeFirst approach during the first launch of the web application. More information on how the
ApplicationUser class can be extended with new fields can be found here.

**Controllers/AccountController.cs** — Finally, we get to the class that is actually using the configuration 
for performing registration and authentication.
